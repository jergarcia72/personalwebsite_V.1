            Jeremy Garcia - You clicked my name, so I figure you want to learn more about me. I’ve been doing design work for a
            number of years and have worn a number of hats, including illustrator, product designer, UX guy and many
            more. I just call myself a graphic designer. I’m looking for work opportunities. Do you have a position
            that I might fit in? Shoot me an <a href="mailto:contact@jergarcia.com">email</a>. Here is my résumé, if you are interested.
            <br><br>
            Do you like what I’m doing here? Follow my instagram. I post there pretty often. I’m not on twitter
            much, but you like it, I am their there too.
            <br><br>
            I’m originally from Utah and moved to New York City to persue a masters degree at SVA. I’m a twin (This
            is what my twin is up to).
            <br><br>
            When I’m not working, I’m likely at a museum with Ali Garcia. Or watching a movie. My favorite movie is
            Django Unchained. I’m also obsessed with Music.

            I want to also include some of my favorite designers, studios and artist so you can enjoy them too. Actual
            Source is kinda a hometown hero of mine. The Collected Works have been amazing mentors to me and make
            rad&trade;
            work. Dia Studio is basically what I want to be when I grow up. For being just a couple of labrador
            retrievers, Young Jerks really just kill it. Zach Lieberman does some of the most amazing work with Open
            Frameworks. There was a time in my life when I didn’t know about PantsPants and I don’t want to talk about
            it.
            <br><br>
            You’re still reading? Okay. Lets talk briefly about web design. Isn’t it so boring how some webpages are
            created and layed out now-a-days? They all look like sandwhiches of content, created with templates and
            delivered the same way. Where is the consideration for the content? Where is the delight? Lets get some
            other web going. Right?
