                            People who live in New York City know how difficult it can be to find an apartment. With a city that is over 65% renters, high demand creates a seller's market, resulting in high costs and low quality. My personal experience moving to New York brought me to searching for a solution. Hey Neighbor is a digital platform that shares insider details about apartments, ensuring NYC renters find comfortable and safe living conditions.

                        Research and Understanding
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        After talking with NYC tenants, I recognized the lack of information they had before committing to a new home. Is the super responsive? Will my neighbors party all hours of the night? Just how bad are the cockroaches? Can my landlord really raise the rent that much? The answers to these questions can't be easily found on the web (if at all), and landlords know it. Landlords and the city frequently take advantage of these information deficits and leave tenants to pick up the pieces.
                        <br>
                        The conversations lead me to ask:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How might more information about specific apartments be provided to tenants before they negotiate and sign expensive contracts?
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Market Research:
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I initially wanted to see what tools were already on the market for tenants seeking information on apartments. I noticed the websites I found relied on two types of data:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Government-collected data (e.g., code violations or 311 complaints regarding a specific building).</li>
                        <li>User-generated data (e.g., reviews connected to buildings).</li>
                    </ol> 
                    <p>
                        What can we learn from what's already on the market?
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/product/1/compdiagram.jpg"class="resize" alt="marketDiagram">

                    <h2>
                        Based on research and personal experience with finding an apartment in NYC, I quickly realized that renters need a one-stop web tool that offers practical data and personal reviews.
                    </h2>

                    <h3>
                        Creating and Testing the Prototype
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        I wanted to validate the hypothesis quickly without having to build the functionality of the tool out. With that goal in mind, I created a news article prototype that NYC tenants could quickly read. I edited the HTML on the tech news site Quartz to create a custom web article that could pass as legitimate tech news. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Included with the prototype is an article that featured a solution already on the market (Rentlogic) and compared it to my solution (Hey Neighbor). Rentlogic takes information directly from government sources to create a letter rating (similar to restaurant letter ratings), while Hey Neighbor provides two separate ratings—one based on government data and another on tenant reviews. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can read more about the differences of the services on the <a href="https://jergarcia.com/q-prototype/q-prototype.html" target="_blank">live prototyped article.</a> 
                        <br>

                        Along with this, I mocked up Hey Neighbor’s landing page to help describe the service further if a user clicked through the article to view the home page.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I then sat down with the potential user and told them they found this article shared on social media. I then asked them and read the full article. I observed if what they would do while reading the article. Some users would click through to one of the service's homepages, but more often we would discuss what their impressions where about what they read. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If they stayed on the article I proceeded to ask a number of questions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are these services you would use? Why?</li>
                        <li>What kind of value do you see each of these companies bringing?</li>
                        <li>Would you prefer one over the other? Why?</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How do you feel that the website is delivering on promises you read</li>

                        <li>After seeing both, which service would you prefer?</li>
